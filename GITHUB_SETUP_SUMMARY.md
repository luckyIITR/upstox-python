```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run the Setup Script
```bash
./scripts/setup_repository.sh
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Name: `upstox-python` (or your preferred name)
- Make it public
- Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/upstox-python.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Set Up GitHub Secrets
- Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Add `PYPI_API_TOKEN` with your PyPI API token

### 5. Create First Release
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 🔧 What's Included

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Runs on every push and PR
   - Tests against Python 3.7-3.11
   - Runs linting (black, flake8, mypy)
   - Generates coverage reports
   - Uploads to Codecov

2. **Release Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
   - Triggers on tag pushes
   - Automatically builds and publishes to PyPI
   - Creates GitHub releases with release notes

3. **Dependency Review** (`.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`)
   - Scans dependencies for security vulnerabilities
   - Runs on pull requests

### Issue Templates

- **Bug Report Template**: Structured bug reporting
- **Feature Request Template**: Organized feature requests
- **Pull Request Template**: Standardized PR process

### Documentation

- **README.md**: Comprehensive project documentation
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development guidelines
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history tracking
- **SECURITY.md**: Security policy and reporting
- **PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md**: Detailed publishing instructions

### Code Quality Tools

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Flake8**: Linting
- **MyPy**: Type checking
- **Pytest**: Testing framework
- **Coverage**: Test coverage reporting

## 📋 Checklist Before Publishing

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Code quality checks pass (black, flake8, mypy)
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] Version numbers are updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] GitHub repository is created
- [ ] GitHub secrets are configured
- [ ] First release is tagged and pushed

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Version Management
- Follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update version in both `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for each release

### Code Quality
- Run tests before every commit
- Use pre-commit hooks for automatic formatting
- Maintain high test coverage
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

### Security
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Keep API keys secure

### Documentation
- Write clear, comprehensive docstrings
- Provide working examples
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document breaking changes clearly

## 🔄 Release Process

1. **Update version numbers**:
   ```bash
   # Update pyproject.toml and setup.py
   # Update CHANGELOG.md
   ```

2. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.1"
   git push
   ```

3. **Create and push tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Build the package
   - Run tests
   - Publish to PyPI
   - Create GitHub release
